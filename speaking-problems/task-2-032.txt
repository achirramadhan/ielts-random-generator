Describe something you did in your study or work that has made you feel confident.

You should say:

- when and where it happened
- what you did
- why it made you feel confident

And explain how you felt about it.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
