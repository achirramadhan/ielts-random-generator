Describe a big city you would like to visit.

You should say:

- which big city you would like to visit
- how you would travel there
- what you would do there

and explain why you would like to visit this big city.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
