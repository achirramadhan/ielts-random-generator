Describe a cultural place where you would like to go to (e.g. a library, museum, theatre).

You should say:

- where it is
- how you knew this place
- what it is like

And explain how the place is related to culture.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
