Describe a monument (e.g., a statue or sculpture) that you like.

You should say:

- what this monument is
- where this monument is
- what it looks like

and explain why you like this monument.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
