Describe some food or drink that you learned to prepare.

You should say:

- what food or drink you learned to prepare
- when and where you learned to prepare this
- how you learned to prepare this

and explain how you felt about learning to prepare this food or drink.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
