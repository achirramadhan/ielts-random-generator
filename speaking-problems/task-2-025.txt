Describe the most expensive item you have ever bought.

You should say:

- when and where you bought it
- what it was
- what you used it for

And explain whether you are glad you bought it

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
