Describe a tourist attraction in your country that you would recommend.

You should say:

- what the tourist attraction is
- where in your country this tourist attraction is
- what visitors can see and do at this tourist attraction

and explain why you would recommend this tourist attraction.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
