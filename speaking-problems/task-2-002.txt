Describe a person from your country who has won a prize, award or medal.

You should say:

- who this person is
- which prize, award or medal they received
- what they did to win this

and explain whether you think it was right that this person received this prize, award or medal.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
