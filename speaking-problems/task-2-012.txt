Describe a person who likes to read a lot

You should say:

- who this person is
- how you know him or her
- what he or she likes to read

And explain why you think he or she likes to read a lot.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
