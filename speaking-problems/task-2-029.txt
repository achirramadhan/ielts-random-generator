Describe your favourite food at a festival or a special event in your country.

You should say:

- what it is
- at which festival or event you eat it
- how it is made

And explain why you like it

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
