Describe a challenge you faced that you thought was difficult.

You should say:

- what it was
- when and where you faced it
- why you thought it was a difficult challenge

And explain how you felt at the time

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
