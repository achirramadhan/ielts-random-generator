Describe a law that was introduced in your country and that you thought was a very good idea.

You should say:

- what the law was
- who introduced it
- when and why it was introduced

and explain why you thought this law was such a good idea.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
