Describe a place you visited that has beautiful views.

You should say:

- where this place is
- when and why you visited it
- what views you can see from this place

and explain why you think these views are so beautiful.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
