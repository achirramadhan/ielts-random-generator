Describe a time when you answered a phone call from someone you didnâ€™t know in a public place.

You should say:

- when and where it happened
- what he or she said
- how you responded

And explain how you felt about the experience.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
