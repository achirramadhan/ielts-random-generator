Describe a person who likes to make things by hand (e.g. toys, furniture)

You should say:

- who this person is
- what he or she makes
- why he or she likes to make things by hand

And explain how you feel about the person.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
