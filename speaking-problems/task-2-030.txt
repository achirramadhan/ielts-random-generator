Describe a photo that is special to you.

You should say:

- when and where it was taken
- who are in the photo
- why it is special to you

And explain whether you will keep it for a long time.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
