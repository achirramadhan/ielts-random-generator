Describe an old friend you had lost touch with and got in contact with again.

You should say:

- who he or she is
- how you knew each other
- why you lost contact
- how you got in contact again

And explain how you felt after getting in contact again.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
