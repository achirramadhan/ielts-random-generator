Describe your favourite news source.

You should say:

- what it is and how often you use it
- what other news sources you use
- what types of news you are interested in

and explain why this is your favourite news source.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
