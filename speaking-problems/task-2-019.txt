Describe a shop where you received a good service from a staff member in a shop

You should say:

- where the shop is
- when you received the good service
- what service you received

And explain how you felt about the service.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
