Describe a time when you helped a family member or relative.

You should say:

- when it happened
- who you helped
- how you helped

And explain how you felt about the experience.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
