Describe a place in your country where you can see wild animals

You should say

- where it is
- when you went there
- what animals you saw there

And explain how you feel about the place.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
