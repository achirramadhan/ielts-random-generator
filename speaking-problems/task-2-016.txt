Describe a person who has chosen a career in the medical field (e.g. a doctor, a nurse)

You should say:

- who he or she is
- what he or she does
- why he or she chose this career

And explain how you feel about him or her.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
