Describe a prize you have received recently (e.g. money, something valuable, a medal)

You should say:

- what it was
- when you received it
- what you did to receive it

And explain how you felt about it.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
