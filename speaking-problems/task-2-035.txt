Describe a time when you asked someone for advice

You should say:

- who this person was
- why you asked for the advice
- what the advice was

And explain how you felt about the advice.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
