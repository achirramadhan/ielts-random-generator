Describe a car journey you made that took longer than expected.

You should say:

- where you were going
- who you were with
- how you felt during the journey

and explain why this car journey took longer than expected.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
