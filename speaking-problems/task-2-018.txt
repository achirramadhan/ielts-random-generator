Describe an ideal place where you would like to live (e.g. a house, an apartment).

You should say:

- where it would be
- what it would look like
- what special features it would have

And explain why this place would be ideal for you.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
