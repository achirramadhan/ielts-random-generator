Describe an online video that taught you something new.

You should say:

- when and where you watched it
- what it was
- why you watched it

And explain what you have learned from it.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
