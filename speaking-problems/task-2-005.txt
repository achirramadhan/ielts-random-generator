Describe a food or drink you like to prepare.

You should say:

- what the food/drink is
- who taught you to prepare it
- where and when you learned

and explain how the learning process made you feel.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
