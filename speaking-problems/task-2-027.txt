Describe a movie you like that you watched recently.

You should say:

- when and where you watched it
- who you watched it with
- what it was about

And explain why you like this movie.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
