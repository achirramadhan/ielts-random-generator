Describe a time when you enjoyed visiting a member of your family in their home.

You should say:

- who you visited and where they lived
- why you make this visit
- what happened during this visit

and explain what you enjoyed about this visit.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
