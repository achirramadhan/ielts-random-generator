Describe a person who has strong opinions.

You should say:

- who this person is
- how you knew him or her
- why you think he or she is a person who has strong opinions
- what kinds of strong opinions this person has

And explain how you feel about his or her opinions.

And you will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you are going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.
